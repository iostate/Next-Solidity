Today I am creating a dApp in Next.js. The goal of the application is to show the contributions to the campaign publicly, in the most transparent way possible. The app will show the requests made to withdraw moeny from the contract, the number of people who have donated to the campaign, the amount of money the campaign has left to spend, and the address of the manager of the contract. 

Openness and transparency, two pillars of democracy.
